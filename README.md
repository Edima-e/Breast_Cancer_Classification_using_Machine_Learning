## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to **classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign** using the popular **Breast Cancer dataset**. Multiple machine learning algorithms were tested and compared to identify the most accurate and reliable model for prediction.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python**
* **pandas**, **numpy** â€“ Data manipulation
* **matplotlib**, **seaborn** â€“ Data visualization
* **scikit-learn** â€“ Model building & evaluation
* **imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)** â€“ Handling class imbalance

## âœ… Key Steps in the Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handled missing values and encoded labels
   * Standardized features using **StandardScaler**
   * Applied **SMOTE** to balance classes

2. **Model Training & Evaluation**

   * Algorithms tested:

     * Decision Tree
     * Random Forest
     * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   * Metrics used: **Accuracy**, **F1-score**, **ROC-AUC**, **Confusion Matrix**

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**

   * Used **GridSearchCV** and **RandomizedSearchCV** for optimal model performance

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

* **Random Forest** and **SVM** performed best in terms of accuracy and ROC-AUC.
* Class imbalance was successfully addressed using **SMOTE**, improving minority class predictions.
* Visualization of **confusion matrices** and **ROC curves** helped compare models effectively.
